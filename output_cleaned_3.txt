Assessments Homework 20%, three Midterm Exams 15% each, Final Exam 35%.  The overall grading scale is A 90–100%, B 80–89%, C70–79%, D60–69%, E 0–59%. The three mid-term exams will take place during regular class meetings on February 14, March 27, and April 24.  The final exam will be sometime during the week of Apr 29–May 4; the specific time and date is determined by the registrar’s office and they will let us know by mid-March.  No calculators, notes, cell phones, headphones, math tattoos, etc., are allowed on exams, unless otherwise stated. Homework assignments are due at 1115am – 10 minutes before the start of class – each Wednesday. Late work will be penalized.  Write your work on paper (or a tablet) and scan them, convert them into a single PDF file, then submit it on Blackboard. You should plan to collaborate with classmates, use Campuswire, and come to office hours for help from time to time.  But you should always write your final solutions individually, on your own. Some assignments will require mostly straightforward computations, but often there will be more challenging problems, so you should always start early and allot time for getting help and for revisions. Your work must be written clearly, legibly, and concisely and will be graded on mathematical correctness and presentation. Points will be deducted for sloppiness, incoherent or insufficient explanation, or for lack of supporting rationale. The penalty for cheating is a score of zero on the assignment or exam, with possible further penalties imposed at the university level, such as suspension or expulsion.
