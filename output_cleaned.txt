Lecture Science Hall 105 Course Description Anatomy and Physiology II (A&P II) is the second of a two-part sequence for the intended nursing major that details human anatomy and physiology from an organ system approach.  A&P II will cover the nervous system, lymphatics and immune system, respiratory system, digestive system, urinary system, endocrine system, and the reproductive system with some information about human development and heredity and an introduction to electrolytes, fluids and acid-base balance. Course content will also include discussions about health/disease issues of concern as they pertain to the current course material.  This class meets the NS LO1 Sophia Program Liberal Learning designations. Offered spring semester for first-year intended nursing majors; 3 hours of lecture and 3 hours of lab per week. SPLL and Course Outcomes 1 A Saint Mary’s student uses scientific methods to investigate questions appropriate to the natural sciences. 2 A Saint Mary’s student demonstrates specific knowledge of processes and principles underlying natural phenomena. 3 A Saint Mary’s student identifies, analyzes, and evaluates critical scientific issues and approaches pertaining to the issues that face her as a citizen. Required Text  Human Anatomy and Physiology, 2nd ed. by Erin C. Amerman (ISBN 978-0-13-478807-4) Note The electronic textbook with Mastering access is required (you can also purchase a hard copy of the textbook for a reduced price if you choose). You will be expected to read the chapters in the textbook that are covered during lecture. You will be responsible for the material in the textbook unless otherwise specified. Exam and quiz questions will come from the material covered in lecture and lab, which comes directly from the book and Mastering learning resources. Required Mastering Access (Pearson)  You will need access to the Pearson Mastering online learning platform (through blackboard).  You will need to register through blackboard for this course (even if you did this in the fall you must do this again for this specific blackboard course).  Instructions for registering will be available on blackboard.  This is the same account as the fall.  DO NOT PURCHASE A NEW MASTERING ACCOUNT. This course in Pearson is crosson/97541 Homework/Study Tables These will be one-hour sessions where you may review lecture/lab material, ask questions, study for exams, work on assignments, read or do group work. I recommend attending study tables so that you set aside specific time weekly to work on this course.  TAs will also be holding study tables Open Office Hours for questions These are open times for you to come to my office to ask questions or review any material. You can send an email to let me know you are coming or just come to my office anytime during office hours. If you cannot attend during open office hours or homework tables please email me to set up a time. COURSE INFORMATION AND POLICIES Lecture Attendance Attendance is mandatory.  If you are unable to attend class for a legitimate reason, please let me know as soon as possible via email so we can work out a plan. If you do miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to find out what you missed. Attending class is important for learning and performing well on assessments (quizzes and exams). Poor attendance may result in a grade reduction.  Official excused absences can be obtained through Dean Chambers’ in the office of Student Academic Services  kchamber@saintmarys.edu Laboratory Attendance  Laboratory attendance is mandatory.  See additional details in the laboratory syllabus.  If you need to be gone from lab you will need to obtain an official excused absence through Dean Chambers’ in the office of Student Academic Services  kchamber@saintmarys.edu Class Rules Be at class and laboratory on-time.  Refrain from side conversations and/or other disruptive behavior as this is distracting and unfair to other students who are trying to concentrate during class. Communication Important messages and announcements will be sent to your Saint Mary’s e-mail account and/or Blackboard. Check both of these regularly as you are responsible for all e-mails sent to the class list.  I will do my best to 2 respond to emails promptly. Allow 24 hours response time. Resend emails if you do not get a response after 24 hours. Course Cancellation Policy  In the event that I would need to cancel class, I will let you know via email.  If class is canceled, the class time may be made up outside of regularly scheduled class times via video lecture.  I reserve the right to alter the schedule to best accommodate any cancellations. Please see the Institutional Syllabus for Policies on the following         http//www.saintmarys.edu/academics/resources/registrar • Academic Honesty • Accommodations for Disabilities • Alternative Formats for Blackboard Ally • Add/Drop and Course Withdrawal Policies • Non-Discrimination Policy • Title IX Policy METHODS OF ASSESSMENT Exams There will be four exams during the semester and a Final Exam (dates below).  Exams will contain an online portion as well as short answer questions either online or on paper.  Exams may contain matching, multiple choice and short answer questions. All exams are mandatory.  All exams are to be completed independently during the time that is assigned.  You may not reference your notes, book, the internet, or other people to find answers as that is cheating. If you miss an exam for any reason, it is your responsibility to contact me.  I will deal with this on a case-by-case basis. One possible outcome is that you may receive a zero on the exam.  Official excused absences if you miss an exam are obtained through Dean Chambers’ office in Student Academic Services  kchamber@saintmarys.edu In-class quizzes and miscellaneous assignments  There will be about 5-6 lecture quizzes (on-line) during the semester and will be taken at the beginning of lecture. Quizzes will be done independently without the use of notes, internet, or textbook. There may be other in class assignments that will be assigned during the course of the semester. Quiz format may include multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, matching, labelling, and short answer questions. There are no make-ups for quizzes unless extreme circumstances exist. You must be present to receive credit. Your one lowest quiz grade will be dropped at the end of the semester. All other quizzes will count towards your grade. Mastering Homework Assignments Assignments will include online weekly Mastering assignments for each chapter through blackboard. You are responsible for turning in all assignments on time.  There will be no make-up on homework assignments. There will be one dropped grade from this category. Final Exam The final exam will cover material from the entire semester including a section on new material (material covered following exam 4). The final exam will follow the same format as the other exams. Your Grade BIO 142 is an integrated lecture and laboratory course; thus, students will receive a single grade for both. Your grade in this course will be based on the following types of assessments In class Quizzes and miscellaneous assignments 12.5% Mastering Homework assignments 12.5% Exams (4 semester exams) 45% Final Exam 10% Lab (pre-labs, post labs, & lab quizzes) 20% 3 Assessment category Average percentage for each assessment category written as a number.  So an 80% will be written as 80 (not 0.8) Multiply the percentage for each type of assessment by the weighted value (shown below) to get the total point value Total point value for each assessment Exams (4 ) multiply by 0.45 In-class Quizzes/Misc. Assignments multiply by 0.125 Mastering Homework Assignments multiply by 0.125 Final Exam multiply by 0.10 Lab multiply by 0.20 Total = The total for this column is your percentage in this class The grading scale for this course is A    93-100% B+  87-89.9% C+  77-79.9% D+  67-69.9% A-   90-92.9% B    83-86.9% C    73-76.9% D    60-66.9% B-  80-82.9% C-  70-72.9% Scores below 60% will be given a grade of F. 4 Tentative Schedule  I reserve the right to alter this schedule during the semester.  If I do change the schedule, I will inform you of any/all changes in a timely manner.  I will do my best not to change exam dates. * Lecture Quizzes will be announced at least one class prior (48 hours in advance)** Date Lecture Topic Reading and (Assignments) Week #1 Mon.
