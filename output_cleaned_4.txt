Recitation  L01 Tuesday 0835am–950am, PS-213; L02 Thursday, 0835am–950am, PS-213 Laboratory L01 Tuesday 1000am–1115am, PS-265A L02 Thursday, 1000am–1115am, PS-265A Objectives by the completion of this course, students will be expected to be able to 1.Analyze electric charges, fields and forces that are represented & used in several basic configurations or distributions. Students are expected to apply vectors in two & three dimensions. 2. Simplify calculations of various electric and magnetic characteristics by taking advantage of special symmetries in conjunction with laws including Gauss’, Ampere’s and Biot-Savart’s. 3. Describe how we store or transfer electrical & magnetic energy in various types of materials and how that energy is used to move charges or perform external work in devices like generators and motors. 4. Analyze how circuit components like resistors, capacitors & inductors can be modified or combined to affect electrical and magnetic fields & energies and how these values change over time and location. 5. Mathematically represent traveling electromagnetic waves and how they change over space and time. 6. Apply integrals, derivatives & trigonometry to represent & evaluate what happens in real applications. 7. Translate concepts and formulas to real-world applications by developing laboratory methods, conducting experiments, taking and recording accurate measurements, analyzing and synthesizing data and communicating your results effectively to an external audience. This course will use the Achieve Macmillan ( www.achieve.macmillanlearning.com )learning online platform. It uses the FlipitPhysics pre-lecture, quiz & homework system in combination with an e-book from OpenStax (www.openstax.org). You can join the course by invitation from your instructor or by purchasing your access through a direct link  https//store.macmillanlearning.com/us/storefront/202310780 . The first one gives you the option to register for 14 days grace period free of charge. The second one only allows you to purchase the access outright. The Course ID you will need is 22v8ff The title of the course is  Phys 221 -1 E&M Leyarovska (MW 835AM Spring 2024) Textbook  OpenStax University Physics , Volume 1-3 by William Moebs, Samuel J. Ling, Jeff Sanny E-book version available free of charge for the duration of the class as part of the Achieve pre- lecture, quiz & homework system. A free PDF version of all three volumes can be downloaded from https//openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-2. (Optional) FlipItPhysics Electricity and Magnetism, (ISBN-13 978-1-4292-7239-1 or ISBN-10 1-4292- 7239-2) by Gary Gladding, Mats Selen, Tim Stelzer This is the book version of the interactive prelectures, checkpoints and home works of the course Prelectures and Checkpoints Prelectures and checkpoints are assigned via the online Achieve system before every lecture and are due at 700 AM  the day of the lecture. There is one day extension with 10% penalty. Two lowest scores will be dropped. Homework Homework will be assigned via the online Achieve system after every lecture. Both Monday and Wednesday assignments are due on MONDAYS at 1159 PM the next week. There is one day extension with 10% penalty. Two lowest scores will be dropped. Quizzes Quizzes will be administered during recitations. They will be based primarily on homework or problems covered that day by your TA. There are NO MAKE-UPS, but your two lowest scores will be dropped. Laboratory Laboratory will meet WEEKLY. The manuals are available at https//www.iit.edu/physics/student-resources. Some weeks your report will be a worksheet; other weeks your report will be a formal write-up. Which labs require which type of report will be made clear to you by your TA. There are NO MAKE-UPS, but your two lowest lab scores will be dropped. Labs not done incur a zero and turning in a report late incurs a penalty (See the Lab Policy document). Please note This class does not have final for the lab sessions. Your 12 Lab reports are essentially your final spaced over the duration of the course. The completion of at least 8 Lab Sessions (lab and submitted lab reports) are required to receive a passing grade in this course. Exams There will be two midterms & a final (see schedule on next page). These will be closed book and closed note. A calculator is the ONLY ALLOWED ELECTRONIC DEVICE. No smartphones please. A formula sheet will be provided. . NO MAKE-UPS except in cases where an official University excuse has been granted by the Dean’s office. Academic Honesty Policy All students are expected to follow IIT’s Academic Honesty policy which is found at https//web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code- academic-honesty. A first violation results in a grade of zero for that assignment, lab, exam or quiz. Subsequent violations result in a failing grade in the course. Grading The percentage weighting assigned to each component of this class is given below as is the overall grading scale for the class. Prelectures & Checkpoints 10% Max % Grade Min % Homework 15% 100 A 90 Quizzes 8% 89 B 70 Lab 16% 69 C 60 First Midterm 16% 59 D 50 Second Midterm 16% 49 F 0 Final 19% Accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources as soon as possible. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3F3- 1 at 10 W 35th St., telephone 312-567-5744 or email disabilities@iit.edu.
