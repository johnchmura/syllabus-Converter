It is possible to envision a time when there wasn’t oil painting (before the fifteenth century), or video art (before 1964), but drawing seems to have always been with us. - Laura Hoptman, Drawing Now Tacita Dean, The Montaton Letter, 2017 Chalk on Blackboard, 366 x 732 cm. BLACKBOARD Go to https//bblearn.saintmarys.edu for all course documents & information. COURSE DESCRIPTION This is a broad foundation course, similar to ART 101, with additional emphasis on the figure/portrait and an introduction to the use of color. Projects are designed to enhance the understanding and use of formal elements, principles and composition while exploring drawing’s creative and expressive potential.  A variety of drawing media, tools and subjects are explored.  Studio projects are augmented by critiques, visual presentations and discussion. Sketchbook required. COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES Students develop basic technical skills in drawing including an understanding for rendering form, surface, light, and space. Through application, students demonstrate a basic understanding of the formal design elements & principles (e.g. use of line, shape, value, texture, color, scale/proportion, perspective, balance, harmony/variety, etc…). Students gain a basic understanding of the application of color theory. Students engage in creative problem solving and develop aesthetic and conceptual skills by exercising visual awareness, imagination, interpretation and personal expression. In small group and full class forums, students learn to effectively present, defend, analyze and critique a work of art. Students become familiar with historic and contemporary examples of artist drawings (western and non-western) through classroom presentations and independent research. Students develop an understanding of drawing’s functions from preliminary study to finished work and the multiple forms drawing can take by investigating a variety of tools and media. Through practice, students enhance their appreciation for art and its role in our intellectual and cultural life. SOPHIA _ LO1 - Arts for Living - Creative and Performing Arts Learning Outcomes 1.

CRITIQUE, EVALUATION & ATTENDANCE  Work will be critiqued in class during and upon the completion of assignments.  In addition, students  will  receive  written  evaluation  of  assignments/portfolios. Evaluation will consider concept, form, craft and involvement/effort. Late work, without proper excuse, will be accepted up to one week following  due  date  and  reduced  one  letter  grade.   Re-worked assignments will be accepted and are encouraged. (Grades on re- worked assignments will be averaged with original grade for drawing. Re-worked assignments must be turned in within 2 weeks of return of original drawing.) Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absence will adversely affect your final grade.  After one, continued unexcused absence will result in the  reduction  of  your  final  grade  by  3  points  per  unexcused absence. Please notify instructor of absences due to illness, family emergency, etc. that may be excused. Prolonged absence may make it necessary for you to withdraw from the course (see Bulletin).

Remaining Artist Reports K- W Drawing is something where you have a really direct, immediate relationship with the material, with the paper and pencil in front of you.  So you make a mark, and then you make another mark in relation to that mark, whereas with a lot of my sculpture, I have a  concept, and then it’s labor.   With drawing, you’re in the present.  In drawing you take physical energy out of your body and put it directly on the page. - Kiki Smith Kiki Smith ART 102 DRAWING II Instructor Sandi Ginter sginter@saintmarys.edu SUPPLY LIST Note All ink and paper required for assignments will be provided.
