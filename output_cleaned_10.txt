It will be strictly enforced. COURSE OBJECTIVES Course Learning Goals Student will gain a clear intuitive understanding of the concept of partial differential equation and its relevance to describing physical phenomena such as diffusion and wave propagation. Students will gain deeper understanding of the Fourier series by mastering the theory of boundary value problems. Students will learn the separation of variables method to solve linear parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations Students will gain practical knowledge of the numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations using the finite difference method. Students will learn the basics of the spectral Fourier transform method for solving PDEs on an infinite or semi- infinite domain. Course Outcomes Students can derive the heat equation from basic principles such as energy conservation and the Fourier law of heat conduction Students can calculate and visualize Fourier cosine or sine series of a function of one variable. Students can prove orthogonality and uniqueness of solutions to a boundary value problem. Students can use the Rayleigh Quotient to gain information about the lowest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunctions for a boundary value problem Students can write down the complete solution of a linear homogeneous wave, heat or Laplace’s equation on a rectangular or rotationally-symmetric domain using separation of variables. Students can apply the concept of linearity to solve non-homogenous PDEs by the method of linear superposition. Students can solve the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions using finite difference approach will develop an understanding of computational algorithms that are used to approximate numerical solutions of mathematical problems. Students can use the Fourier transform method to solve the heat equation and the Laplace’s equation in a semi- infinite plane or strip. Course Assessment The assessment of objectives will be achieved through homework assignments, quizzes, and common examinations testing each of the specific outcomes listed above. POLICIES DMS Course Policies All DMS students must familiarize themselves with, and adhere to, the Department of Mathematical Sciences Course Policies, in addition to official university-wide policies. DMS takes these policies very seriously and enforces them strictly. Grading Policy The final grade in this course will be determined as follows Homework 35% Midterm Exam 30% Final Exam 35% Your final letter grade will be based on the following tentative curve. A 90 - 100 C 61 - 74 B+ 82 - 89 D 52 - 60 B 75 - 81 F 0 - 51 C+ 68 - 74 Attendance Policy Attendance at all classes will be recorded and is mandatory. Please make sure you read and fully understand the Math Department’s Attendance Policy. This policy will be strictly enforced. Homework and Quiz Policy Homework problem sets will be posted onto Canvas by the instructor each week, and may include problems requiring basic coding in MATLAB or Mathematica. Homework is in general due each week; late work is not accepted; rare exceptions may be given if the work is submitted the same day. In case of absence, homework may be sent to the instructor via email. Email Policy It is important that you regularly check your NJIT email account for class assignments and announcements from your instructor. Rutgers students should email the instructor their preferred email address at the start of the semester. Make-up policy No make-ups are allowed for missed quizzes and midterm exam. If your documented absence is cleared with the Dean of Students, the corresponding score will be dropped from the final grade calculation, so there is no penalty in such cases, but there will be no make-up administered. Attendance Attendance in this class is mandatory. A couple missed lectures over the course of the semester will not impact your grade, but try and borrow notes from your classmates if you have to miss a class. Exams There will be one midterm exam held in class during the semester and one comprehensive final exam. Exams are held on the following days Midterm Exam Lecture 15, 2020 Final Exam Period May 8 - 14, 2020 The final exam will test your knowledge of all the course material taught in the entire course. Make sure you read and fully understand the Math Department's Examination Policy. This policy will be strictly enforced. Makeup Exam Policy There will be NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES OR EXAMS during the semester. In the event an exam is not taken under rare circumstances where the student has a legitimate reason for missing the exam, the student should contact the Dean of Students office and present written verifiable proof of the reason for missing the exam, e.g., a doctor’s note, police report, court notice, etc. clearly stating the date AND time of the mitigating problem. The student must also notify the Math Department Office/Instructor that the exam will be missed. Policy on Academic Integrity Academic Integrity is the cornerstone of higher education and is central to the ideals of this course and the university. Cheating is strictly prohibited and devalues the degree that you are working on. As a member of the NJIT community, it is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the academic code of integrity policy that is found at http//www5.njit.edu/policies/sites/policies/files/academic-integrity-code.pdf. Please note that it is my professional obligation and responsibility to report any academic misconduct to the Dean of Students Office. Any student found in violation of the code by cheating, plagiarizing or using any online software inappropriately will result in disciplinary action. This may include a failing grade of F, and/or suspension or dismissal from the university. If you have any questions about the code of Academic Integrity, please contact the Dean of Students Office at dos@njit.edu Cellular Phones All cellular phones and other electronic devices must be switched off during all class times.
