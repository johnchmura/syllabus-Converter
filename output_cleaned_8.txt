Dr. Chris Dwyer Math Center Hours Monday 900 am – 1000 am, 100 pm – 200 pm and 300 pm – 400 pm Tuesday 1100 am – 100 pm Wednesday 900 am – 1000 am and 100 pm – 200 pm Thursday 1100 am – 100 pm Friday 100 pm – 200 pm and 300 pm – 400 pm Textbook  These is no textbook required for this course.  Outlines for notes, homework problem sets and other needed information are available on Blackboard. Other Tools  You will need a calculator with the capability for computing powers, roots, and binomial coefficients.  If you are taking this course as a prerequisite for Math 114  Introduction to Statistics, you will want a graphing calculator of at least the level of the TI-83/84 series for that course and should therefore also use it for this course.  The calculator used on quizzes and exams must be a stand-alone device (no cell phones, etc). Course Description  The mathematical content of the course is taken from discrete (non-continuous, not calculus based) mathematics.  Topics to be studied are those useful in a variety of applications and in understanding many public issues (economics, medical research, politics, and business planning) in which uncertainty or variation are important or optimization is a goal.  The topics are 1. Set Theory (as a basis for classification and description); 2. Numerical Combinatorics (enumeration, counting of possibilities); 3. Probability (the mathematical approach to uncertainty and the language used for stating conclusions in medical, economic and other statistical studies); 4. Basic Statistical Terminology (random variables, basic description of “typical value” and variation); 5. Linear Programming (the current work-horse for maximizing gain, minimizing costs in constrained situations). This course meets the general education requirements for the Mathematical Arts. Learning Outcomes  The Sophia Learning Outcomes are formatted in italics.  Elaboration as to the application of these outcomes in this course follow in plain formatting. 1. A Saint Mary’s student uses mathematical language and concepts to phrase and answer questions pertaining to a variety of real-world contexts.  In particular, she will use the language and notation of mathematics correctly and be able to (a)read problems (both theoretical and applied) for comprehension to obtain information necessary to solve the problems; (b)identify posed problems as to type studied in class; (c)identify representations of appropriate sets and variables according to the type of problem; and (d)articulate the solution to posed problems using precise language and notation. 1. A Saint Mary’s student formulates mathematical models using abstract and logical reasoning.  In particular, she will use the concepts of set theory, combinatorics, probability theory, statistics, and linear programming to formulate mathematical models. 1. A Saint Mary’s student uses and interprets models to analyze systems and patterns.  In particular, she will (a)interpret and translate complex problems by modeling word problems in mathematical form and carrying out the solution; (b)choose an appropriate technique for a posed problem; (c)carefully implement the technique; (d)explain the answer in context of the model and originally stated problem; and (e)adapt techniques to a more general context. Procedures and Policies Attendance  A student is expected to attend class.  Attendance will be taken for record keeping purposes, but will not directly affect your grade.  Makeup for unexcused absences for a quiz or an exam are at the discretion of the professor. Cancellation Policy  Class cancellations will be announced during class time or through e-mail.  In the event of a last-minute cancellation, a member of the math department will make an announcement or post a note on the door. Assignments  You should expect to work 6 – 9 hours per week outside of class time plus 3 hours of class time.  (This includes watching videos, reviewing/rewriting notes, study for quizzes and exams, and homework assignments.) Homework is assigned for the benefit of the student.  It provides the student with an opportunity to improve her understanding of the material, to reinforce her knowledge, and to catch weaknesses in her understanding before they become critical.  It is expected that a student do every assignment and turn it in on the date due.  Homework will be assigned on a regular basis and will be posted on Blackboard.  Unless otherwise stated, homework will be due at the beginning of class every Wednesday.  For unexcused absences, homework is expected to be submitted by the due date. Send your written work with another student in the course or scan and email the work to me if you absent.  Late homework may be accepted but will not receive full credit.  It is fine (and often helpful) to discuss notes, assignments and solutions with other students, but all submitted work should be your own. Quizzes  Unless otherwise announced, short quizzes will be given each Friday over the previous week’s material. Unannounced and unscheduled quizzes may also be given. Academic Honesty Policy  The college policy on academic honesty as detailed in the student handbook will be enforced.  In this course academic dishonesty will result in a grade of 0 for the work involved.  On quizzes and tests, no assistance (including other people, books, notes, etc.) is permitted.  You should work together and/or seek help from the instructor on regular assignments, but each student must hand in her own work and is responsible for her own understanding.  Copying of results is never acceptable.  For more information, see the College Policy on Academic Honesty on the Academic Affairs and First Year Studies website on Academic Policies. For students with disabilities  Any student who is eligible or believes she may be eligible for accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Accessibility Resource Office (103C Madeleva, x4262). The ARO will review documentation and arrange for appropriate and legal accommodations.  Requests for accommodations will not be honored without notification from the ARO.
